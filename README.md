# Neural_Architecture_Search
This repo contain the code of Neural Architecture Search which i have implemented from scratch in pytorch. I have used RNN model for searching the best suitable architecture for a cnn model which is used to make a classifer which classify our standard mnist dataset. The heart of this model is the RL reinforce algo.
